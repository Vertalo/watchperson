# This is a configuration file for using `.gitignore`-style path matching
# to glob the paths of documentation artifacts from within a repo in order
# to gather them and serve them locally. This brings the documentation
# closer to the code and will allow devs to edit and preview a repo's docs
# without pushing and re-deploying `internal.vertalo.com`. This
# methodology will also be used by `internal.vertalo.com` to injest repo
# documentation during the building of that project.

# We are using a Python package called `pathspec` that implements the
# `.gitignore` syntax. It is used in the root-level `gather` executable
# file.

# Note that, while we're using the same path-matching syntax as
# `gitignore`, we're using it to decide what to *include* in doc
# gather, serving, and injestion vs. `gitignore`'s *ignoring* methodology.

# See: [https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

# The following will match `docs` directories and their contents along
# with any other extraneous `.md` files (excluding files named `chris.md`)
# while excluding from certain directories including the `mkdocs-docs`
# directory (where the documentation will be gathered), virtual
# environments, and other Python-related cache-type directories.

# Include all docs directories and their contents, plus other markdown files
**/docs/*
**/*.md

# Exclude markdown files called `contentious_consensus.md`
!contentious_consensus.md

# Other files to exclude
!.DS_Store

# Exclude contents of certain directories including the document target (mkdocs-docs)
# and other Python-related directories

!__pycache__

# Exclude files and directories related to virtual environments and env vars
