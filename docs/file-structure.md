# CSV data specifications - Specially Designated National (SDN)

Format *.csv consists of records separated by carriage returns (ASCII character 
13), with fields (values) within records delimited by the "," (comma) symbol 
(ASCII character 44).

Null values consist of "-0-" (ASCII characters 45, 48, 45).

The Comma Separated Values (.csv), release consists of three  ASCII text files -- a main
file listing the name of the SDN and other information unique to that entity
(sdn.csv), a file of addresses (add.csv),  and a file of alternate names (alt.csv).
Addresses and alternate names are linked to particular SDNs using unique integer
values in a linking or primary key column. The integers used are assigned for
linking purposes only and do not represent an official reference to that entity.

Releases of the database-format files are intended as a service to the user
community.  OFAC's SDN list is published in the Federal Register.  All of OFAC's
lists are drawn from the same underlying data and every effort has been made to
ensure consistency.  The Federal Register will govern should differences arise. 
Due to the nature, urgency, and sensitivity of the programs  which OFAC
administers and enforces, it may not always be possible to  provide advanced
notice to users of format changes to the database  structure.
